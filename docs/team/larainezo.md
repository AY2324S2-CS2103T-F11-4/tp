### Project: Dormie

Dormie is an application developed for college students living in dorms. It helps them connect with their dorm mates in a simple way. With Dormie, they can easily see when their friends are free, and keep track of their important dates and contact details. It makes organising social events less stressful and helps students stay connected with each other.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=laraine&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-02-23&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=larainezo&tabRepo=AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/remove freeTime tags.
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  * What it does: allows the user to add/remove freeTime tags for each contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because different contacts can have changing free time and the app should provide a convenient way to modify them.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing add/edit contact commands and modifications to data structures (i.e. HashSet).
  * `addTime` command: [\#94](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/94)
  * `deleteTime` command: [\#86](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/86)
* **Modified existing features**:
  * Updated the types of data that is stored for each contact - Telegram handle, room number, birthday. [\#43](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/43)
* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub
* **Enhancements to features**:
  * Wrote additional tests for add/remove freeTime tag commands [\#94](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/94) [\#86](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/86)
  * Added welcome message and a quick guide to display to users when the application starts [\#124](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/124)
  * Added logging for actions performed on contact [\#92](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/92)
