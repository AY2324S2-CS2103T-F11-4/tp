<img src="docs/images/dormie.png" width="250">

Welcome to **Dormie**, designed to help you keep tabs on where your friends reside in NUS College for easy meetups. Simply note down their names, room numbers, and any important details. This logbook is your handy guide to quickly locate friends when you need a chat or advice. Let's make staying connected a breeze in our community!

P.S. It is named `Dormie` because it is a playful and friendly abbreviation of "dormitory.".

  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Dormie_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
