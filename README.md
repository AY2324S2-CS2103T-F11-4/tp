<img src="docs/images/dormie.png" width="250">

Welcome to **Dormie**, designed to help you keep tabs on where your friends reside in NUS College for easy meetups. Simply note down their names, room numbers, and any important details. This logbook is your handy guide to quickly locate friends when you need a chat or advice. Let's make staying connected a breeze in our community!

P.S. It is named `Dormie` because it is a playful and friendly abbreviation of "dormitory.".
